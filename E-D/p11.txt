Problem 1
-------------------------
 Dijkstra and Cable Cars
-------------------------

Buildings in Rotterdam numbered from 1 to N are connected via M cables with associated costs C_1,C_2,...,C_M and there is only one car in the city which can run over these cables in both the directions. One day K posts with destinations D_1,D_2,...,D_K arrive in Rotterdam at a building S. The car can carry at most one post at a time and is initially located at some building T. The car when loaded incurs cost C_i while travelling over the cable i but costs zero when empty. 

You have to find the minimum cost incurred while delivering maximum number of posts.

Note : There can be multiple cables between two buildings and some buildings may not be reachable from S.
Beware of overflows (Use long long instead of int).

Input Format:
-------------
First line contains 3 integers N, M and K.
The next M lines contain 3 integers U_i, V_i and C_i each denoting the two ends and cost of the cable i.
Next line has K integers D_1,D_2,...,D_K specifying the destinations of posts.  
Last line contains 2 integers S and T.

Output Format:
--------------
Output a single integer denoting the minimum cost incurred as specified in the problem statement.

Constraints:
------------
2 <= N <= 10^4
1 <= M <= 10^5
0 <= K <= 10^6

0 <= C_i <= 10^4
1 <= D_i,U_i,V_i,S,T <= N
